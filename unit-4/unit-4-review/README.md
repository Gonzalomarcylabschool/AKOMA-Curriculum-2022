- OO Design
    - Clarify Requirements (ask questions if possible)
    - Figure out primary use cases
    - Identify key objects and their properties
    - Identify behaviors of Objects
    - Identify behaviors between Objects
    - Trivial vs non-trivial methods (demonstration vs. useful)
        - Methods should change object properties
        - Error handling
        - Success/Error messages
- Short Response:
    - `this` (global scope, global function, object method. Arrow functions are a “nice-to-have”)
    - closure
    - encapsulation
    - polymorphism
- Exercises:
    - factory function
    - classes
    - `this`
    - `extends` and `super()`
    - `instanceof`
