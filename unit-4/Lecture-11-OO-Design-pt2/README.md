# Object-Oriented Design Part 2

In the last lecture, we covered an approach to designing classes: 

* Clarify the requirements.
    * Understand the expectations.
        * If possible, ask clarifying questions.
    * 
* Figure out the primary use cases.
    * Think and talk though, what the Object(s) is/are supposed to do. 
* Identify key Objects.
    * How many Objects do you need? What are they? 
* Identify behaviors of the Objects.
    * What are the Objects supposed to do?
* Identify behaviors between Objects.
    * How do the Objects interact with each other, if they do?

## Design Challenge 

Today we are going to design an Amazon Store using Object Oriented JavaScript. What classes can you create? and How are they related?

For example, you cound have a `User` class, an `Cart` class, and an `Item` class.

A User has a cart (and only one cart), but a cart can have a list of many items.

There are many possible solutions, and you get to be as creative as you want to be!
