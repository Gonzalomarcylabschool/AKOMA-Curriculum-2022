Let's take a moment to answer the essential question. To check our understanding.

What is encapsulation? Why do we use it? How do objects enable it?

How do objects encapsulate state? How do they encapsulate behavior?

What are factory functions and why are they useful?

What are examples of how we can create factory functions?

## Private Variables

Lets go over what Private variable are.

In general, private variables are those variables that can be visible and accessible only within the class they belong to and not outside the class or any other class. 
```js
class Rectangle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}

class  Square {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}
class Circle {
  constructor(height, width) {
    this.height = height;
    this.width = width;
  }
}
```

What are private variables? What is the JavaScript naming convention for private variables?

## Naming Conventions in OOP
* camelCase for all variables (properties) and functions (methods).
* TitleCase for all ES6 Classes and constructor functions. 
* _ is used to denote a variable thatâ€™s supposed to be private.

## Shopping Cart - Object Practice

Do the following in a blank JavaScript file.

1. Create an object called `cart` using Object literal syntax (`{}`).
2. Add a `shopper` property to your `cart` object whose value is a string for the name of the shopper.
3. Add an `items` property to your `cart` object whose value is an empty array. This array will hold values of the form: `{ itemName, price }`
4. Add an `addItem` method to your `cart` object. It should accept two arguments: `itemName` and `price`. It should add an object to the `items` array with the form `{ itemName, price }`.
5. Invoke your `cart` obejct's `addItem` method 3 times on your `cart`, adding in the following items:
    * `'Apple'` with a price of `1`
    * `'Banana'` with a price of `0.5`
    * `'Cherry'` with a price of `2.5`
6. Print your `cart` object's `item` array to the console. You should see an array with the three item objects that you just added.
7. Add a `getTotal` method to your `cart` object. It should calculate and return the sum of the prices of all of your cart's items.
8. Invoke your `cart` object's `getTotal` method and print the returned value to the console. If you've been following along, it should return `4`.
9. Add a `removeItem` method. It should accept one argument: `itemName`. It should find the provided item your cart's `items` array and remove it if it is found. 
10. Invoke your `cart` object's `removeItem` method passing in one of your cart's items.
11. Print your `cart` object's `items` array to the console. You should NOT see the removed item.
12. Add a `removeMostExpensiveItem` method. It should find the most expensive item in your cart's `items` array and remove it.
13. Invoke your `cart` object's `removeMostExpensiveItem` method passing in one of your cart's items.
14. Print your `cart` object's `items` array to the console. You should NOT see the removed item.


## Notes
* **Encapsulation** is the idea that data (properties) and behavior (methods) are bundled together. The behavior interacts with the data in a _fixed_ and _predictable_ interface. Some people refer to it as "data hiding" because data is primarily accessible via methods.
  * This `cart` example demonstrates **encapsulation** because the cart's data and the methods that interact with that data are all bundled in one object.
* **State** refers to the current values of the properties in an object. It can also refer more broadly to the current values of the variables in a program.
* A **factory function** is a function that creates an object with a particular set of properties and methods.
  * We can create multiple **instances** of the shopping cart object by invoking the factory function. Each instance will have the same properties and methods.
* Benefits of Factory Functions:
   * I don't have to copy/paste the entire object each time I want to make a new instance. I can just invoke the factory function to make a new instance.
   * If I want to add a new behavior (method) to carts created by the factory, I can add it one place instead of having to add it to each object individually. Same goes for bugs that may be found in methods. I only need to fix the bug in one place.
* The `this` object is a special variable that holds a different object depending on _where_ you reference it. Within object methods, it is the object that the method is being called on.

```js
const obj = {
  getThis() {
    return this;
  }
}

console.log(obj === obj.getThis()); // prints true

console.log(this);
```

* All of this is a process of **abstraction**. We create these objects with data and methods _once_ so that in the future, we can work with the _more abstract_ object's methods to interact with the data inside.
