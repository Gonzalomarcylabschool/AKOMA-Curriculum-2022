# Lecture Prep Material

## Lecture Prep
This is all of the code and concepts that the lecture will cover. However, it may be broken up into several different files to convey time passing. For more information check the README inside the prep. It will cover the broad strokes skills we're looking to teach in that lecture.

The idea is that you will have this code available as a "get out of jail" card. Keep a the repo open during your lecture, off screen. If something breaks, at each step of the way, you know where you *should* be, and can cut and copy from the primary source to get there.

## Lecture
This is where your lecture should *start*. Make a copy of this folder and use it for the actual lecture with students. Whether you then upload the folder directly to GitHub or include it in some master lecture repo for your class is up to you.

> However, make sure the students see all of the prep code at some point, because assignments will be built assuming everything in the base lecture prep code was covered at least a *little*.
