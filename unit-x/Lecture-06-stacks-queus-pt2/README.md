# Stack and Queues Pt2

Stacks and queues are both common data structures used in computer science. They are used to organize and manipulate data in specific ways.

A stack is a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. This means that the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. Stacks are often used in situations where the order of operations is important. Some common use cases for stacks include:

Implementing undo/redo functionality in a software program
  when you control/command z something. 
Implementing a back button in a web browser
  When you move back in your browser after you opened a bunch of pages. 
Keeping track of function calls in a program (call stack)

A queue is a first-in, first-out (FIFO) data structure. This means that the first element added to the queue is the first one to be removed. Queues are often used in situations where items need to be processed in a specific order. Some common use cases for queues include:

Implementing a task scheduler
Implementing a print spooler
Handling requests in a web server
Implementing message queues for inter-process communication

Both stacks and queues are widely used in the computer science and are implemented in many programming languages and libraries. They are also used as building blocks for more complex data structures such as trees and graphs.
