Primitive data types are store as single values:

```js
let csScientistOne = "Vint Cerf" 

let csScientistTwo = "Grace Hopper"

let csScientistThree = "Alan Turing"

let csScientistFour = "Barbara Liskov"

```

Now storing data into variables this way would take so much time. Especailly if you had to do this for thousands or even tens of thousands of variables.

The array solve this exact proble 

objects have properties, 
arrays have index, they are like list, they have an order. 

index: the position that the element is at
elements: the data in the array
