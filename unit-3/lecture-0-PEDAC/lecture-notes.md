What is the benefit of taking a structured approach to solving complex problems?
What types of problems are best suited to the PEDAC approach?
As we break down our problem, how do we test at each step of the way?

What is PEDAC and what does it stand for?

[Understand the] Problem, Examples / Test Cases, Data Structure, Algorithm, and Code.‚Äù PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C).
There are many was of solving coding problems but a proven method of doing so is
