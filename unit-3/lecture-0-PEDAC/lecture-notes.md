## The Why

You have been solving a lot of coding questions with data structures and algorithms but do you understand the importance of it. Students and Developers have this opinion that data structure and algorithms only help in interviews and after that, there is no use of all those complicated stuff in daily jobs. 

You might be happy with learning a new language or framework and building some applications with that but once you will enter the real world industry, you will realize that your job is not just writing the code and make things work. The real job will bez to write the right amount of good code, which means it should be efficient and robust and here comes the role of data structures and algorithms. Data Structures and Algorithms not only help in getting the logic for your program but also helps in writing the efficient code for your software. 

What is the benefit of taking a structured approach to solving complex problems?

There are many was of solving coding problems but a proven method of doing so is taking a sturctred approach.
When you are trying to solve a problem you should be thinking of these questions:

1. Did you understand the problem fully?
2. Would you be able to explain this question to someone else?
3. What and how many inputs are required?
4. What would be the output for those inputs
5. Do you need to separate out some modules or parts from the problem?
6. Do you have enough information to solve that question? 

What is PEDAC and what does it stand for?

[Understand the] Problem, Examples / Test Cases, Data Structure, Algorithm, and Code.‚Äù PEDAC has two primary objectives: process the problem (PEDA) and code with intent (C). an article on [PEDAC](https://medium.com/launch-school/solving-coding-problems-with-pedac-29141331f93f).

What is an agorithm?

A procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation.

What types of problems are best suited to the PEDAC approach?
As we break down our problem, how do we test at each step of the way?
