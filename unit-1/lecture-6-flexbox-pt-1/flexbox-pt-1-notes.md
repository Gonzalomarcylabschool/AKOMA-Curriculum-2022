# Flexbox 

## The what and why

### The what:

Flexbox is 

### The why:

* Repsonsive sites
* Make it easier to posistion elements. 
* Better for content flow.
* Supported across browser

### Axis

* There are 2 axis that flexbox used
    * `main` and `cross` axis
* Axis are dictated by the `flex-direciton` property.
    * By default `flex-direction` is set to `row`. This will make the `main` axis go from left to right of the screen and the `cross` go from top to bottom.
    * To change this you must set the `flex-direction` to a value of `column`. The `main` will then go from top to bottom and `cross` to go from left to right of the screen.
