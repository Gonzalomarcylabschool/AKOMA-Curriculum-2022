- What is state?
Current data that a component holds can be updated. can get data from a parent component managed and controlled inside the Component itself. They can be reflected in different components 

- How are props and states different?

Context is a way for a React Component to share information with other Components without passing it through props.

* Step 2: Build A Static Version in React
* Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI
State
* Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live
* Step 5: Add Data Flow and Inverse Data Flow
