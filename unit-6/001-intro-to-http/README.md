# Intro to HTTP

## The Why

In unit 5 we learned how to create dynamic pages using the DOM and DOM manipulation. 

In this unit we are now going to understand how computer talk to each other and how we can use that to our advantage to do even more as a developer!

## What is the internet

Short answer: a distributed packet-switched network

The internet is a vast network of interconnected devices, including servers, routers, and computers, that communicate with each other using standardized communication protocols. Here is a simplified overview of how the internet works:

Data is sent from a device: When you access a website or send an email, your device sends data packets to the internet.

Data is routed: Your data packets are routed through a series of routers, which are specialized computers that direct the packets towards their destination.

Data is transmitted: The data packets are transmitted over the internet using a variety of different communication protocols, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and the Internet Protocol (IP).

Data is received: The data packets are received by the destination device, which may be a server hosting a website, a recipient's email server, or another type of device.

Data is reassembled: The data packets are reassembled into their original form, such as a web page or email message, and sent to your device for you to view or interact with.

This process happens in a matter of milliseconds, and it is what enables people to access information, communicate with others, and engage in online activities all over the world.

## Clients and Servers

Clients and servers are two fundamental concepts in the architecture of the internet, they work together to enable communication and data transfer. Clients make requests for data or services, and servers respond by providing the requested data or services. An analogy would be if you go to chipotle, you would be the client who request a burrito the server or chipotle employee responds to  your request and provides the requested burrito. 

A client is a computer or device that makes requests for data or services from another computer or device, known as a server. In other words, a client is a user's device that sends requests to servers over the internet. Examples of clients include web browsers, email clients, and mobile apps.

A server, on the other hand, is a computer or device that responds to client requests and provides the requested data or services. Servers are designed to handle a large number of requests and to provide resources or data to multiple clients simultaneously. Examples of servers include web servers, email servers, file servers, and database servers.

When you browse the internet, for example, your web browser acts as a client, sending requests for web pages to web servers around the world. The web servers respond by sending the requested web pages back to the client, which displays them on the user's device. Lets take a look at what happens when I try to go to google.com
